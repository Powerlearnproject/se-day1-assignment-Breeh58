### Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

**1. What is Software Engineering?**
   - **Definition:** Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of software and systems.
   - **Importance in Technology Industry:**
     - Ensures that software is reliable, efficient, and meets user needs.
     - Facilitates the creation of complex systems that are essential for various industries like finance, healthcare, and communications.
     - Plays a crucial role in the scalability, maintainability, and security of software applications.

**2. Key Milestones in the Evolution of Software Engineering:**
   - **Milestone 1: The Advent of High-Level Programming Languages (1950s)**
     - Languages like FORTRAN and COBOL allowed developers to write code in a more human-readable form, abstracting away machine-level details.
   - **Milestone 2: The Development of Structured Programming (1970s)**
     - Introduced concepts like functions, loops, and conditionals, improving code clarity and reducing errors.
   - **Milestone 3: The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s)**
     - Languages like C++ and Java promoted the use of objects, classes, and inheritance, enabling more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

**3. Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):**
   - **Requirement Analysis:** Gathering and analyzing user requirements.
   - **System Design:** Designing the system architecture based on requirements.
   - **Implementation (Coding):** Writing the actual code.
   - **Testing:** Verifying that the code meets the specified requirements.
   - **Deployment:** Releasing the software to users.
   - **Maintenance:** Updating and fixing the software post-deployment.

**4. Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies:**
   - **Waterfall:**
     - Linear and sequential approach.
     - Each phase must be completed before the next begins.
     - Example Scenario: Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal changes, such as government contracts.
   - **Agile:**
     - Iterative and incremental approach.
     - Focuses on flexibility, customer feedback, and rapid delivery.
     - Example Scenario: Ideal for projects with evolving requirements, such as startup product development.

**5. Roles and Responsibilities in a Software Engineering Team:**
   - **Software Developer:**
     - Writing and maintaining code.
     - Collaborating with other team members to design and implement features.
   - **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:**
     - Developing and executing test plans.
     - Identifying and reporting bugs.
   - **Project Manager:**
     - Coordinating the project timeline.
     - Ensuring that the project meets its goals and deadlines.

**6. Importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS):**
   - **IDEs:**
     - Example: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA.
     - Importance: Provides tools for writing, testing, and debugging code efficiently.
   - **VCS:**
     - Example: Git, SVN.
     - Importance: Manages changes to source code, allows collaboration, and maintains a history of project development.

**7. Common Challenges Faced by Software Engineers and Strategies to Overcome Them:**
   - **Challenge 1: Managing Technical Debt**
     - Strategy: Regular code reviews and refactoring.
   - **Challenge 2: Keeping Up with Rapid Technological Changes**
     - Strategy: Continuous learning and professional development.
   - **Challenge 3: Balancing Quality with Speed**
     - Strategy: Implementing Agile practices and automated testing.

**8. Types of Testing:**
   - **Unit Testing:** Tests individual components or functions. Ensures that each part works correctly in isolation.
   - **Integration Testing:** Verifies that different components or systems work together.
   - **System Testing:** Tests the complete system to ensure it meets requirements.
   - **Acceptance Testing:** Validates the system against user requirements, often involving the customer.

### Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

**1. What is Prompt Engineering?**
   - **Definition:** The process of designing and optimizing prompts to effectively interact with AI models.
   - **Importance:**
     - Helps achieve accurate and relevant AI responses.
     - Enhances user experience by improving AI communication.

**2. Example of a Vague Prompt and Improvement:**
   - **Vague Prompt:** "Tell me something about software."
   - **Improved Prompt:** "Explain the difference between software engineering and computer science, focusing on their roles in the tech industry."
   - **Effectiveness:** The improved prompt is specific, guiding the AI to provide a focused and relevant response, reducing ambiguity.
